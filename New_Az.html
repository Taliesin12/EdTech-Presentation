        <h2>Using Modularity and Standardization</h2>
        <p>In the past Standardization has put a greater pressure on teachers to teach to a test and not meet the needs of the students. But if Standardization can be coupled with Modularity, it will put less pressure on individual teachers to preform specific tasks and allow them to leverage their unique abilities in new ways.</p>
        <h2>Better uploading to Universities and Careers</h2>
        <h2>Metrics</h2>
        <h3>dollar per degree not dollar per student</h3>
        <p><strong>To be Clear the only real goal at this point is to improve the interface between the Arizona Public Education System and ASU.</strong> </p>
        <p>There are already many necessary acomplishments in other companies to solve many educational issues. Making a better interface between a university and High School will be a small change that will completely change the future of education.</p>
        <p>other companies are trying to make changes in high schools but change in the public education system is extremely difficult. Change is much more available in a university if the President of the university is wanting this.</p>
        <h2>Security and Fraud</h2>
        <p>there needs to be a way to overcome security and fraud problems. maybe an airgap, or using the public library system to check identities.</p>

        <h2>Why Arizona?</h2>
        <h3>Arizona is Desperate</h3>
        <p>For a long time Arizona has had terrible education policy. It is getting worse and worse. Teachers are on the border of strike </p>
        <h3>Asu is a university that loves innovation</h3>
        <p>To follow the laws of supply and demand you are going to make a demand and the supply will follow. If Asu will accept a new metric they are creating the demand. The supply will follow.</p>
        <h3>Arizona is a Conservative State</h3>
        <p>The conservative ideals of the arizona constituency would love industry coming in to solve a government problem.</p>

      <div class="concept">
        <h2>Why Google?</h2>
        <h3>Google has interests in education</h3>
        <h3>Google has the manpower and assets to do it quickly</h3>
        <h4>Kahn Academy</h4>
        <h4>Youtube</h4>
        <h3>The solution is going to need to be Technological</h3>

      </div>

      <div class="concept">
        <h3>blockchain technology</h3>
        <p>blockchain technology is just begining to show what it can do. one of the things that it claims is to get rid of trust issues. if a person is able to develop a blockchain implementation that extremely reduces fraud there should be a way to attach the students knowledge measurements to that profile and it is secure. knowing that indeed the student does know that stuff and that no one did the work for them. </p>
