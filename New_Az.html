        <h2>Using Modularity and Standardization</h2>
        <p>In the past Standardization has put a greater pressure on teachers to teach to a test and not meet the needs of the students. But if Standardization can be coupled with Modularity, it will put less pressure on individual teachers to preform specific tasks and allow them to leverage their unique abilities in new ways.</p>
        <h2>Better uploading to Universities and Careers</h2>
        <h2>Metrics</h2>
        <h3>dollar per degree not dollar per student</h3>
        <p><strong>To be Clear the only real goal at this point is to improve the interface between the Arizona Public Education System and ASU.</strong> </p>

        <h2>Security and Fraud</h2>
        <p>there needs to be a way to overcome security and fraud problems. maybe an airgap, or using the public library system to check identities.</p>

        <h2>Why Arizona?</h2>
        <h3>Arizona is Desperate</h3>
        <p>For a long time Arizona has had terrible education policy. It is getting worse and worse. Teachers are on the border of strike </p>
        <h3>Asu is a university that loves innovation</h3>
        <p>To follow the laws of supply and demand you are going to make a demand and the supply will follow. If Asu will accept a new metric they are creating the demand. The supply will follow.</p>
        <h3>Arizona is a Conservative State</h3>
        <p>The conservative ideals of the arizona constituency would love industry coming in to solve a government problem.</p>

        <h4>Kahn Academy</h4>
        <h4>Youtube</h4>
        <h3>The solution is going to need to be Technological</h3>
