    <h2>Prussian model of education</h2>
    <h3>The ability of the EdTech is not suited to the ABCDF model of knowledge assesment. it would be like taking 4k video and displaying it on an old black and white television</h3>
    <h2>The education system is entrenched and would be too dificult to change. it is a large industry and when something like that is </h2>

    <h3>We currently have many standards in education. The most important standard in today's education system is time. </h3>
    <h3>the system was the best fit for what they needed it for. it would be too much work for the teacher to be able keep track and convey such small peices of information. therefore they used a grading system and taught in batches. </h3>
    <h3>Education is too politicized</h3>
    <h4>would need to convince school board members or voters that this is a good idea.</h4>
    <h2>there is no reciprocity</h2>
    <h3>all of these companies have great information about the students but they are not able to keep any of that information when that student uses a new program or moves to a different school.</h3>
