    <h1>Characteristics of Solution</h1>
    <h4>Needs to be able to be consitent in quality but adapt to individuals and teachers. This is going to be able to be flexible but part of its strength will be based on the ability to know what a student knows and how to fill the gaps in what they dont know.</h4>
    <h2>Standards</h2>
    <h3>to be able to do this it needs to have a standard. We currently have many standards in education. The most important standard in the solution is quality.</h3>
    <h2>Modular</h2>
    <h3>The system will be modular because it isn't the creation of content. it is the defining of content and the relationship between that content.</h3>
    <h2>Granular</h2>
    <h3>Today all the information is reduced down to having a grade, number, or even just a piece of paper. today we do have the technology to really have our measurement have much more into consideration.</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Counting</li>
      <li>Counting by multiples</li>
      <li>addition</li>
      <li>Subtraction</li>
      <li>Multiplication</li>
      <li>Division</li>
      <li>etc.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
      <li>Alphabet</li>
      <li>Spelling</li>
      <li>Reading</li>
      <li>Vocabulary</li>
      <li>Sentence Structure</li>
      <li>paragraph</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>these are all things that are done today in school board requirements, acredditaion requirements and sylubi. This is not saying that things need to be taught a certain way or even in a certain order (although there will be commonsence prerequisites i.e. alphabet before spelling) The training will be customized to each student. </h3>
    <h2>BlockChain</h2>
    <h3>Blockchain is the ability to make contracts and other information much more difficult to forge. a student will have a profile that can only be changed by certain acreddited places of educatiton. basically all schools and universities. If someone is wanting to be homeschooled they will beable to do much of the work the same way as anyone else they will just need to be verified at a public library to take the tests to show that someone else is not doing their work.</h3>
    <h2>Nodular</h2>
    <h3>Because these different components of knowledge will be measured and taught seperately the differing algorithms will be able to see what works best for a student and prepare next lessons accordingly.</h3>

    <h2>Michael Crow</h2>
    <h3>His goal is a new type of university. one that measures it's quality not on how exclusive it could be but by howmany people it helps prepare for the real world</h3>
